Greeting ! 

I'm Florian PEREZ, Atlassian passionate & Atlassian specialist.

This repo is a compilation of all the content I've found during my research about Atlassian products.

Some of the scripts are also personnals creations, needed for some uses cases in missions

So far [08/09/2021] I've compiled 841 scripts/scripted fields/fragments/tools... (some does pretty much the same things) 

Feel free to fork this repo, ask for modifications on some scripts, report bugs or mistakes or make a pull request. 

Thanks you !
